This is my flask final for Systems Design and Analysis

My flask app was created using simple HTML and CSS web development along with flask and sqlite to create database functionality for the reservations booking and confirmation elements of the app.

I utilized sqlite inside of python in order to cut down on the amount of command prompts needed as I'm inexperienced with linux and this made the project go by 20 times smoother
